abstract = {Indonesia is the most important producer country of snapper and grouper species worldwide, with a notable increase in landings over the past decades. The Java Sea is one of the most frequently fished areas for these species in Indonesia, but in 2016 a decrease in landings was observed. This study applied two approaches (Length-based Indicators and Length-Structured Growth-Type-Group Model) to assess the status of snapper and grouper fisheries in the Java Sea, using length-composition data from the commercial fishery and covering multiple gears with different selectivity. The work focused on the dominant species in the catches: Malabar blood snapper (Lutjanus malabaricus), Areolate grouper (Epinephelus areolatus), Crimson snapper (Lutjanus erythropterus), and Goldbanded jobfish (Pristipomoides multidens). Considerable differences were observed, related to the type of gear used. Catch data obtained from the longline fishery presented good stock status indicators for all species studied. The spawning potential ratio (SPR) estimates calculated for Malabar blood snapper and crimson snapper indicated that these species are currently fished in the Java Sea at unsustainable levels (below 30 {\%} SPR) by the dropline and mixed-gear fleets, while areolate grouper and goldbanded jobfish are not overfished (above 30 {\%} SPR). For both methods, bias in Linf and, secondarily, bias in M/K have a stronger influence on the indicators values, in particular for the proportion of individuals above the length of optimal yield + 10 {\%} (Pmega) estimates and SPR, than bias in Lmat values. This study highlighted other areas where improvements are critical to ensure the sustainability of the snapper and grouper fisheries in the Java Sea.},

abstract = {? 2014 ? International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2014. All rights reserved.Evaluating the status of data-poor fish stocks is often limited by incomplete knowledge of the basic life history parameters: the natural mortality rate (M), the von Bertalanffy growth parameters (L? and k), and the length at maturity (Lm). A common approach to estimate these individual parameters has been to use the Beverton-Holt life history invariants, the ratios M/k and Lm/L?, especially for estimating M. In this study, we assumed no knowledge of the individual parameters, and explored how the information on life history strategy contained in these ratios can be applied to assessing data-poor stocks. We developed analytical models to develop a relationship between M/k and the von Bertalanffy growth curve, and demonstrate the link between the life history ratios and yield- and spawning-per-recruit. We further developed the previously recognized relationship between M/k and yield- and spawning-per-recruit by using information on Lm/L?, knife-edge selectivity (Lc/L?), and the ratio of fishing to natural mortality (F/M), to demonstrate the link between an exploited stock's expected length composition, and its spawning potential ratio (SPR), an internationally recognized measurement of stock status. Variation in length-at-age and logistic selectivity patterns were incorporated in the model to demonstrate how SPR can be calculated from the observed size composition of the catch; an advance which has potential as a cost-effective method for assessing data-poor stocks. A companion paper investigates the effects of deviations in the main assumptions of the model on the application of the analytical models developed in this study as a cost-effective method for stock assessment [Hordyk, A.

abstract = {This study extended a “data-limited” length-based stock assessment approach to a risk analysis context. The estimation-simulation method used length frequencies as the principal data in lieu of catch and effort. Key developments were to: (i) incorporate probabilistic mortality and growth dynamics into a numerical cohort model; (ii) employ a precautionary approach for setting sustainability reference points for fishing mortality (FREF) and stock reproductive biomass (BREF); (iii) define sustainability risks in terms of probability distributions; and, (iv) evaluate exploitation status in terms of expected length frequencies, the main “observable” population metric. This refined length-based approach was applied to six principal exploited reef fish species in the Florida Keys region, consisting of three groupers (black grouper, red grouper, and coney), two snappers (mutton snapper and yellowtail snapper), and one wrasse (hogfish). The estimated sustainability risks for coney were low ({\textless}35{\%}) in terms of benchmarks for fishing mortality rate and stock reproductive biomass. The other five species had estimated sustainability risks of greater than 95{\%} for both benchmarks. The data-limited risk analysis methodology allowed for a fairly comprehensive probabilistic evaluation of sustainability status from species and community perspectives, and also a frame of reference for exploring management options balancing sustainability risks and fishery production.},

abstract = {The majority of global fish stocks lack adequate data to evaluate stock status using conventional stock assessment methods. This poses a challenge for the sustainable management of these stocks. Recent requirements to set scientifically based catch limits in several countries, and growing consumer demand for sustainably managed fish have spurred an emerging field of methods for estimating overfishing thresholds and setting catch limits for stocks with limited data. Using a management strategy evaluation framework we quantified the performance of a number of data-limited methods. For most life-histories, we found that methods that made use of only historical catches often performed worse than maintaining current fishing levels. Only those methods that dynamically accounted for changes in abundance and/or depletion performed well at low stock sizes. Stock assessments that make use of historical catch and effort data did not necessarily out-perform simpler data-limited methods that made use of fewer data. There is a high value of additional information regarding stock depletion, historical fishing effort and current abundance when only catch data are available. We discuss the implications of our results for other data-limited methods and identify future research priorities. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {Analytical solutions for biological reference points are derived in terms of maximum lifetime reproductive rate. This rate can be calculated directly from biological parameters of maturity, fecundity, and natural mortality or a distribution for this rate can be derived from appropriate metadata. Minimal data needs and assumptions for determining stock status are discussed. The derivations lead to a re-parameterization of the common stock-recruit relationships, Beverton-Holt and Ricker, in terms of spawning potential ratio. Often, parameters in stock-recruit relationships are restricted by tight prior distributions or are fixed based on a hypothesized level of stock resilience. Fixing those parameters is equivalent to specifying the biological reference points. An ability to directly calculate reference points from biological data, or a meta-analysis, without need of a full assessment model or fisheries data, makes the method an attractive option for data-poor fisheries. The derivations reveal an explicit link between the biological characteristics of a species and appropriate management. Predicted stock status for a suite of shark species was compared with recent stock assessment results, and the method successfully identified whether each stock was overfished. {\textcopyright} 2009 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.},

Performance is evaluated with respect to fish life history type, level of stock depletion, data quality, and autocorrelation in recruitment strength. We quantify the robustness of each MP with respect to the various observation processes. Methods using observations of absolute biomass or stock depletion offer the best overall performance and this is consistent across life history types, data qualities, and stock depletion levels. Simple MPs can outperform conventional data-limited methods and data-rich assessments that use time-series of catch and effort data. MP performance is most sensitive to biases in catch data. Our results indicate that often tuning MPs for specific stocks is important, though this may not be viable in data-poor assessment scenarios because of insufficient data and analysis resources. },

abstract = {Age-structured data are commonly needed in stock assessments but are unavailable for the majority of existing fisheries, while fish size (length or weight) data are most readily accessible and carry critical information of population status. However, the performances of assessment methods based on size-frequency data have been less well understood. This study evaluated the reliability of two size-frequency-based assessment methods in R package, s6model and TropFishR, for estimating the exploitation status of one data-poor stock, Pholis fangi in Haizhou Bay, China. We used both simulation and empirical approaches to compare the performances of the two assessment methods in estimating F and Fmsy and examined their robustness to the stochasticity and amount of sampling data. In the simulation test, s6model and TropFishR yielded satisfactorily accurate and consistent estimates of F and Fmsy. In the empirical test, the estimated stock exploitation status varied substantially among seasons. TropfishR and s6model estimated the F/Fmsy to be 2.40 and 2.05 in spring, respectively, indicating remarkable overfishing, and 0.43 and 0.41 in fall, respectively, indicating an optimistic exploitation level. The reflected pattern was consistent with the fishery characteristics of this species. The s6model method was substantially influenced by sample size and might lead to unreasonable estimations in small samples, whereas TropFishR was relatively robust on the changes of sample size. This study highlighted the usefulness of size-frequency methods in guiding fisheries management and provided references for their applications in data-limited situations.},

abstract = {The method of maximum likelihood is widely used in epidemiology, yet many epidemiologists receive little or no education in the conceptual underpinnings of the approach. Here we provide a primer on maximum likelihood and some important extensions which have proven useful in epidemiologic research, and which reveal connections between maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. For a given data set and probability model, maximum likelihood finds values of the model parameters that give the observed data the highest probability. As with all inferential statistical methods, maximum likelihood is based on an assumed model and cannot account for bias sources that are not controlled by the model or the study design. Maximum likelihood is nonetheless popular, because it is computationally straightforward and intuitive and because maximum likelihood estimators have desirable large-sample properties in the (largely fictitious) case in which the model has been correctly specified. Here, we work through an example to illustrate the mechanics of maximum likelihood estimation and indicate how improvements can be made easily with commercial software. We then describe recent extensions and generalizations which are better suited to observational health research and which should arguably replace standard maximum likelihood as the default method. {\textcopyright} The Author 2013.

abstract = {Modeling selectivity, the relative capture probability expressed as a function of fish age or length, in statistical catch-at-age models remains one of the most influential and uncertain parameterizations in developing robust stock assessments to provide resource management advice. Selectivity parameterization affects point estimates of management quantities and associated uncertainty, as well as the estimation of other model parameters, such as fishing and natural mortality, growth, recruitment, and spawner-recruit relationships. The choice of biological data (length or age) and selectivity assumptions (length- or age-based) made by assessment analysts can directly impact final estimates of important management quantities. In this paper, Pacific mackerel and Pacific sardine stock assessments based on the integrated age-structured Stock Synthesis model are used in concert with simulation methods to evaluate the influence such decisions have on the quality (bias and precision) of estimates of maximum sustainable yield, current spawning stock biomass, and depletion. Findings from this evaluation indicate that: (1) when age data are used, the selectivity assumption (length- or age-based) was generally less influential and did not impact the quality of derived management quantities; (2) when length data are used, misspecification of selectivity generally produced more variable findings and lower quality estimates for quantities of maximum sustainable yield and current biomass; (3) estimates of depletion were generally more robust and precise, irrespective of the biological data or selectivity assumption used in the model; and (4) formal examination of selectivity as illustrated in this paper is useful for identifying other parameters potentially misspecified in the overall model. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

abstract = {We evaluate a method for fitting models to time series of population abun- dances that incorporates both process noise and observation error in a likelihood framework. The method follows the probability logic of the Kalman filter, but whereas the Kalman filter applies to linear, Gaussian systems, we implement the full probability calculations numerically so that any nonlinear, non-Gaussian model can be used.We refer to the method as the ‘‘numerically integrated state-space (NISS) method'' and compare it to two common methods used to analyze nonlinear time series in ecology: least squares with only process noise (LSPN) and least squares with only observation error (LSOE). We compare all three methods by fitting Beverton-Holt and Ricker models to many replicate model-generated time series of length 20 with several parameter choices. For the Ricker model we chose parameters for which the deterministic part of the model produces a stable equilibrium, a two-cycle, or a four-cycle. For each set of parameters we used three process-noise and observation-error scenarios: large standard deviation (0.2) for both, and large for one but small (0.05) for the other. The NISS method had lower estimator bias and variance than the other methods in nearly all cases. The only exceptions were for the Ricker model with stable-equilibrium parameters, in which case the LSPN and LSOE methods has lower bias when noise variances most closely met their assumptions. For the Beverton-Holt model, the NISS method was much less biased and more precise than the other methods. We also evaluated the utility of each method for model selection by fitting simulated data to both models and using information criteria for selection. The NISS and LSOE methods showed a strong bias toward selecting the Ricker over the Beverton-Holt, even when data were generated with the Beverton-Holt. It remains unclear whether the LSPN method is generally superior for model selection or has fortuitously better biases in this particular case. These results suggest that information criteria are best used with caution for nonlinear population models with short time series. Finally we evaluated the convergence of likelihood ratios to theoretical asymptotic distributions. Agreement with asymptotic distributions was very good for stable-point Rick- er parameters, less accurate for two-cycle and four-cycle Ricker parameters, and least accurate for the Beverton-Holt model. The numerically integrated state-space method has a number of advantages over least squares methods and offers a useful tool for connecting models and data and ecology.},

The exercise was made up of two steps applied to datasets from 14 representative fish stocks from around the world. Step 1 involved applying stock assessments to datasets with varying degrees of effort dedicated to optimizing fit. Step 2 was applied to a subset of the stocks and involved characteristics of given model fits being used to generate pseudo-data with error. These pseudo-data were then provided to assessment modellers and fits to the pseudo-data provided consistency checks within (self-tests) and among (cross-tests) assessment models. Although trends in biomass were often similar across models, the scaling of absolute biomass was not consistent across models. Similar types of models tended to perform similarly (e.g. age based or production models). Self-testing and cross-testing of models are a useful diagnostic approach, and suggested that estimates in the most recent years of time-series were the least robust. Results from the simulation exercise provide a basis for guidance on future large-scale simulation experiments and demonstrate the need for strategic investments in the evaluation and development of stock assessment methods.},

abstract = {Penalties are widely used for a range of parameters while fitting fish stock assessment models. Penalizing annual recruitments for deviating from an underlying mean recruitment is probably the most common. Assuming that recruits are log-normally distributed for the purposes of this penalty is theoretically justifiable. In practice, however, bias may be induced because this distributional assumption includes a term equal to the summation of the log observed data, which in the case of recruitment equals the summation of the log recruitment parameters that are not data. Using simulation, the potential for bias caused by assuming that recruits were log-normally distributed was explored, and results were contrasted with the assumption that log-recruitment was normally distributed, an alternative that avoids the potentially troublesome summation term. Spawning stock biomass (SSB) and recruitment were negatively biased, while fishing mortality (F) was positively biased under the assumption of log-normally distributed recruitments, and the bias worsened closer to the terminal year. The bias also worsened when the true underlying F was low relative to natural mortality, and with domed fishery selectivity. Bias in SSB, recruitment, and F was nonexistent or relatively small under the assumption that log-recruitment was normally distributed. Distributional assumptions for penalties used in assessment models should be reviewed to reduce the potential for biased estimation. These results also provide further support for simulation testing to evaluate statistical behavior of assessment models.},

For this reason, we estimated age, growth, mortality and recruitment of this species based on three shallow lakes, Biandantang Lake, Shengjin Lake and Kuilei Lake (BDT, SJH and KLH, respectively) in this region. A total of 13,585 (8,818 in BDT, 2,207 in SJH and 2,560 in KLH) individuals were collected during monthly sampling from July 2016 to September 2017. The results revealed that the age structures of T. swinhonis consisted of four age groups (0+-3+), with 0+-1+ year old fish comprising more than 98{\%} of the samples. Allometric growth patterns were displayed by fish from all sampling sites and the von Bertalanffy growth functions estimated were Lt ¼ 173.25 (1 - e-1.20 (t + 1.09)): BDT; Lt ¼ 162.75 (1 - e-1.20 (t + 1.08)): SJH and Lt ¼ 215.25 (1 - e-1.20 (t + 1.12)): KLH, respectively. The rates of total mortality (Z), natural mortality (M) and fishing mortality (F) at BDT, SJH and KLH were computed as 5.82, 5.50 and 4.55 year-1; 1.89, 1.87 and 1.75 year-1; 3.93, 3.63 and 2.80 year-1, respectively. Meanwhile, growth performance indices (f′) were 0.68 (in BDT), 0.66 (in SJH) and 0.62 (in KLH), which indicated that T. swinhonis were overfished slightly in all study areas. Area-specific recruitment patterns were similar to each other, displaying evidence of batch spawning, with major peaks in April and August, accounting for 92.21{\%} (BDT), 88.21{\%} (SJH) and 88.73{\%} (KLH) of total recruitment, respectively. These results showed that brief generation-time, fast growth rate, relatively high natural mortality rate and strong reproductive capacity (r-strategies) are reasons why this species became the most dominant species in many lakes of China.},

abstract = {Australia has developed a Harvest Strategy Policy (HSP) for Commonwealth fisheries. A harvest strategy specifies the management actions necessary to achieve defined resource objectives in a given fishery, resulting in a formal and proactive management approach that is transparent to all stakeholders. The objectives of the HSP are defined in terms of target and limit biomass reference points, although proxies can be used. It is a significant challenge, therefore, to develop harvest strategies for most small fisheries, which are typically data-poor, have only basic or no formal stock assessments, and have low Gross Value of Production (GVP). For the small Commonwealth fisheries, even indirect biomass estimates are unavailable and, due to their low GVP, it is unlikely that relevant research will be undertaken to determine reliable biomass estimates in the foreseeable future. This paper provides insight into developing harvest strategy frameworks that reconcile the reality and limitations of small fisheries with the intent of the HSP: to cease or avoid overfishing, to rebuild overfished stocks, and to maintain stocks at levels corresponding to the maximum economic yield. The process of harvest strategy development is evaluated and general principles for the pragmatic development and implementation of harvest strategies for small, low-value, data-poor fisheries are considered. These general principles include (i) the development of sets of triggers with conservative response levels, with progressively higher data and analysis requirements at higher response levels, (ii) identifying data gathering protocols and subsequent simple analyses to better assess the fishery, (iii) archiving biological data for possible future analysis, and (iv) the use of spatial management, either as the main aspect of the harvest strategy or an augmentation with other measures. The value of an iterative approach involving stakeholders and managers is emphasized. The above principles are illustrated by three case studies from Australia's small Commonwealth fisheries: the Western Deepwater and North West Slope Trawl Fisheries, the Coral Sea Fishery, and the Bass Strait Central Zone Scallop Fishery.

abstract = {The majority of the world's fisheries, by number, are data-poor/limited, and there is a growing body of literature pertaining to approaches to estimate data-limited stock status. There are at least two drivers for assessing the status of data-limited fisheries. The first is to try to understand and report on the global or regional status of fisheries across many stocks. The second is to attempt to assess individual data-limited stocks, for status reporting and/or guiding management decisions. These drivers have led to attempts to find simple, generic, low-cost solutions, including the broad application of generically parameterised models, and the blanket application of a single, or limited number of possible, analytical approach(es). It is unclear that generic methods function as intended, especially when taken out of their original design context or used without care. If the intention is to resolve individual stock status for the purposes of management, there is concern with the indiscriminate application of a single method to a suite of stocks irrespective of the particular circumstances of each. We examine why caution needs to be exercised, and provide guidance on the appropriate application of data-limited assessment methods (DLMs). We recommend: (a) obtaining better data, (b) using care in acknowledging and interpreting uncertainties in the results of DLMs, (c) embedding DLMs in harvest strategies that are robust to the higher levels of uncertainty in the output of DLMs by including precautionary management measures or buffers and (d) selecting and applying DLMs appropriate to specific species' and fisheries' data and context.},

abstract = {This study presents a new method (LBB) for the analysis of length frequency data from commercial catches. LBB works for species that grow throughout their lives, such as most commercially-important fish and invertebrates, and requires no input in addition to length frequency data. It estimates asymptotic length, length at first capture, relative natural mortality, and relative fishing mortality. Standard fisheries equations can then be used to approximate current exploited biomass relative to unexploited biomass. In addition, these parameters allow the estimation of length at first capture that would maximize catch and biomass for a given fishing effort, and estimation of a proxy for the relative biomass capable of producing maximum sustainable yields. Relative biomass estimates of LBB were not significantly different from the "true" values in simulated data and were similar to independent estimates from full stock assessments. LBB also presents a new indicator for assessing whether an observed size structure is indicative of a healthy stock. LBB results will obviously be misleading if the length frequency data do not represent the size composition of the exploited size range of the stock or if length frequencies resulting from the interplay of growth and mortality are masked by strong recruitment pulses.},

abstract = {Spawning stock biomass per recruit (SSBR) estimates the expected lifetime reproductive potential of an average recruit (P), which is an important correlate of population growth potential. The ratio of the fished to unfished magnitude of P is the spawning potential ratio (SPA) and is a measure of the impact of fishing on the potential productivity of a stock. Currenluse of SPR merges concepts developed to quantify the compensation required for population persistence given anthropogenic increases in mortality with observations of stock productivity and SSBR for fisheries in the Western North Atlantic. It has a firm theoretical basis and is evaluated against yield per recruit and contrasted with pther traditional biological reference points. SPR is widely used in U.S. fisheries managed under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, usually in the context of a percentage of the unflShed SSBR. lis implementation is intended to be risk-aversive through selection of minimum acceptable levels above which stocks maintain acceptable productivity. The behavior of the underlying principles suggests SPR values below about 0.2 should be avoided unless thare is evidence for exceptionally strong density-dependence in the stock. Critical levels have typically been set in the range of 0.2 to 0.3 primarily based upon the experience in the northwest Atlantic.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Canadian Science Publishing. All rights reserved.Selectivity in fish is often size-dependent, which results in differential fishing mortality rates across fish of the same age, an effect known as "Lee's Phenomenon". We extend previous work on using length composition to estimate the spawning potential ratio (SPR) for data-limited stocks by developing a computationally efficient length-structured per-recruit model that splits the population into a number of subcohorts, or growth-type-groups, to account for size-dependent fishing mortality rates. Two simple recursive equations, using the life history ratio of the natural mortality rate to the von Bertalanffy growth parameter (M/K), were developed to generate length composition data, reducing the complexity of the previous approach. Using simulated and empirical data, we demonstrate that ignoring Lee's Phenomenon results in overestimates of fishing mortality and negatively biased estimates of SPR. We also explored the behaviour of the model under various scenarios, including alternative life history strategies and the presence of size-dependent natural mortality. The model developed in this paper may be a useful tool to estimate the SPR for data-limited stock where it is not possible to apply more conventional methods.},

abstract = {Stocking of farmed eels is a commonly used management measure across Europe, and partly Asia, to supplement local stocks that chronically suffer from poor recruitment. During the farming process, increased growth and stress-related annulus-like rings are formed, which have been hypothesised to bias ageing and growth estimation. Alizarin red S (ARS) marked European eels (Anguilla anguilla) from eel farms were used to demonstrate that these stress rings cannot be distinguished from potential true annuli. Two readers overestimated the age on average by approximately 2, and up to 7 years in blind readings. In addition, a significant positive correlation between the estimated age and the number of counted stress rings was observed. The individual number of rings inside the ARS mark (i.e., prior to stocking) was used to correct the estimated age, which led to an increase in the calculated growth rate between 18 ± 16{\%} and 108 ± 48{\%}. Furthermore, an age-based cohort model indicated that the stocking-related ageing error strongly affects estimates of total biomass, with potential effects on silver eel escapement, depending on the proportion of stocked recruits. Chemical marking of all farmed recruits in the future is proposed to enable statistically necessary individual age corrections.},

abstract = {Occupancy models are employed in species distribution modelling to account for imperfect detection during field surveys. While this approach is popular in the literature, problems can occur when estimating the model parameters. In particular, the maximum likelihood estimates can exhibit bias and large variance for data sets with small sample sizes, which can result in estimated occupancy probabilities near 0 and 1 ('boundary estimates'). In this paper, we explore strategies for estimating parameters based on maximizing a penalized likelihood. Penalized likelihood methods augment the usual likelihood with a penalty function that encodes information about what parameter values are undesirable. We introduce penalties for occupancy models that have analogues in ridge regression and Bayesian approaches, and we compare them to a penalty developed for occupancy models in prior work. We examine the bias, variance and mean squared error of parameter estimates obtained from each method on synthetic data. Across all of the synthetic data sets, the penalized estimation methods had lower mean squared error than the maximum likelihood estimates. We also provide an example of the application of these methods to point counts of avian species. Penalized likelihood methods show similar improvements when tested using empirical bird point count data. We discuss considerations for choosing among these methods when modelling occupancy. We conclude that penalized methods may be of practical utility for fitting occupancy models with small sample sizes, and we are releasing R code that implements these methods.},

abstract = {Potential users of the model proposed by Froese et al. (2018) should be aware of several issues. First, the method to calculate equilibrium numbers-at-length is incomplete and leads to negatively biased estimates of fishing mortality. Second, inadequate simulation testing fails to reveal that the method is highly sensitive to assumptions of equilibrium conditions and that the population average asymptotic length (L∞) can be approximated by the largest observed size (Lmax). Finally, the Froese et al. (2018) model relies on the assumption that the ratio of natural mortality (M) to the von Bertalanffy growth parameter (K; M/K) is typically around 1.5, which they argue is supported by the literature for most fish stocks. We believe that this conclusion is based on an insufficient reading of the literature and, in fact, there is strong evidence to support the claim that M/K is outside the narrow bounds of 1.2–1.8 for many exploited species. Potential users of the method are alerted to these issues and alternative approaches are recommended to avoid these biases.},

abstract = {Data on the length structure of exploited stocks are one of the easiest sources of information to obtain for data-poor fisheries, and have the potential to provide cost-effective solutions to the management of data-poor fisheries. However, incorporating the results from stock assessments into a formal harvest strategy, defined here as a harvest management system that incorporates monitoring, assessment, and decisions rules for a specific fishery, usually requires information on the total catch or catch-per-unit effort, data that are not available for many data-poor fisheries. This paper describes and tests a harvest strategy where only length composition data of the catch and knowledge of basic biological parameters are available. The harvest strategy uses a recently developed methodology for stock assessment that estimates the spawning potential ratio (SPR) for an exploited stock from the length structure of the catch (the length-based SPR model; LB-SPR), and uses an effort-based harvest control rule to iteratively drive fishing pressure towards a target level of SPR (40{\%}). A management strategy evaluation framework was used to explore the behaviour of various parameterizations of the harvest control rule for three species with a diverse range of life-histories and M/k ratios ranging from 0.36 (unfished population dominated by large fish) to the Beverton-Holt invariant M/k of 1.5 (unfished population dominated by smaller fish). For all three species the harvest strategy was able to guide the fisheries towards the target SPR, although the time taken for the SPR to stabilise at the target SPR was greatest for the species with the greatest longevity and the lowest M/k. The results of this proof-of-concept study demonstrate that the combination of the LB-SPR assessment model with an iterative, effort-based harvest control rule can successfully rebuild an overfished stock back to sustainable levels or fish down a stock to the target SPR without significantly overshooting the target.},

We simulated a stock distributed over two regions with inter-regional migration and different trends in exploitation and tested the performance of extended survivors analysis (XSA) and a statistical catch-at-age model in terms of bias, when spatially restricted tuning series were applied. If we used a single tuning index that covered only the more heavily fished region, estimates of fishing mortality and spawning-stock biomass were seriously biased. If two tuning series each exclusively covering one region were used (without overlap but together covering the whole area), estimates were also biased. Surprisingly, a moderate degree of overlap of spatial coverage of the two tuning indices was sufficient to reduce bias of the XSA assessment substantially. However, performance was best when one tuning series covered the entire stock area. {\textcopyright} 2009 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. Published by Oxford Journals.

The discount factor has been a major focus of debate in recent decades, and nevertheless, the potential effect of the environment and its management on the discount factor has been largely ignored. Here we show that to maximize social welfare, policymakers need to consider discount factors that depend on changes in natural resource harvest at the global scale. Particularly, the more our society over-harvests today, the more policymakers should discount the near future, but the less they should discount the far future. This results in a novel discount formula that implies significantly higher values for future environmental goods.},

In the second stage, parametric growth models, such as the von Bertalanffy seasonal growth curve, are fitted to the summary data. The error structure in this second stage of analysis incorporates random between-year effects, random within-year age-group effects, random within-year time-interval effects, random within-year age-group and time-interval interactions, and sampling errors. This complex error structure incorporating unbalanced crossed and nested random effects acknowledges that commercial fishing is not an exercise in random sampling, and allows for the inevitable additional sources of random variation in such an enterprise. The method is applied to South Australian southern bluefin tuna length frequency data collected from 1964 to 1989, and leads to the conclusion that juvenile tuna grew faster in the 1980s than in the 1960s, with the 1970s being a decade of highly variable growth. {\textcopyright} 2004 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

abstract = {Analysts conducting stock assessments using integrated, age-structured models must discretize length data into a limited number of bins (data bins). Furthermore, some modeling frameworks also allow users to specify a distinct structure for how lengths of fish are represented in the model (model bins). The effect of choices regarding the number and width of these bins on model output is unclear, and these choices are made inconsistently in assessments across regions and species. Here, we used the stock synthesis modeling framework, and the ss3sim stock assessment simulation package, to explore the effects of choices about length discretization on stock assessment performance for three fish life-history types and four data cases. We found that, with all other aspects of a model fixed, increasing the model bin width tended to increase estimates of spawning biomass, but this effect depended on the shape of length-based processes (e.g., growth, maturity, and selectivity). Thus, we suggest analysts using model bins wider than 1 cm explore the effect of this decision on derived management quantities. In the context of estimation, there generally was a predictable tradeoff between estimation accuracy and model run time, with finer model and data bins always improving estimation accuracy and model convergence, but increasing run time. In some cases, wider data bins reduced run time (by up to 50{\%}) with little sacrifice in model estimation performance, particularly those using conditional age-at-length data. This study identifies key aspects to consider when binning length, and provides pertinent information for stock assessment best practice guidelines.},

abstract = {The relationship between the biomass of reproductively mature individuals (spawning stock) and the resulting offspring added to the population (recruitment), the stock-recruitment relationship, is a fundamental and challenging problem in all of population biology. The steepness of this relationship is commonly defined as the fraction of recruitment from an unfished population obtained when the spawning stock biomass is 20{\%} of its unfished level. Since its introduction about 20 years ago, steepness has become widely used in fishery management, where it is usually treated as a statistical quantity. Here, we investigate the reproductive ecology of steepness, using both unstructured and age-structured models. We show that if one has sufficient information to construct a density-independent population model (maximum per capita productivity and natural mortality for the unstructured case or maximum per capita productivity, natural mortality and schedules of size and maturity at age for the structured model) then one can construct a point estimate for steepness. Thus, steepness cannot be chosen arbitrarily. If one assumes that the survival of recruited individuals fluctuates within populations, it is possible, by considering the early life history, to construct a prior distribution for steepness from this same demographic information. We develop the ideas for both compensatory (Beverton-Holt) and over-compensatory (Ricker) stock-recruitment relationships. We illustrate our ideas with an example concerning bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus/orientalis, Scombridae). We show that assuming that steepness is unity when recruitment is considered to be environmentally driven is not biologically consistent, is inconsistent with a precautionary approach, and leads to the wrong scientific inference (which also applies for assigning steepness any other single value).

abstract = {Integrated analysis models provide a tool to estimate fish abundance, recruitment, and fishing mortality from a wide variety of data. The flexibility of integrated analysis models allows them to be applied over extended time periods spanning historical decades with little information from which to estimate the annual signal of recruitment variability to modern periods in which more information about recruitment variability exists. Across this range of data availability, the estimation process must assure that the estimated log-normally distributed recruitments are mean unbiased to assure mean unbiased biomass estimates. Here we show how the estimation method implemented in the integrated analysis model, Stock Synthesis, achieves this unbiased characteristic in a penalized likelihood approach that is comparable to the results from Markov chain Monte Carlo. The total variability in recruitment is decomposed into variability among annual recruitment estimates based on information in the data and a residual variability. Because data are never perfectly informative, we show that estimated recruitment variability will always be less than the true variability among recruitments and that the method implemented here can be used to iteratively estimate the true variability among recruitments.},

abstract = {The coral reef fish community of Hawaii is composed of hundreds of species, supports a multimillion dollar fishing and tourism industry, and is of great cultural importance to the local population. However, a major stock assessment of Hawaiian coral reef fish populations has not yet been conducted. Here we used the robust indicator variable "average length in the exploited phase of the population (L¯)", estimated from size composition data from commercial fisheries trip reports and fishery-independent diver surveys, to evaluate exploitation rates for 19 Hawaiian reef fishes. By and large, the average lengths obtained from diver surveys agreed well with those from commercial data. We used the estimated exploitation rates coupled with life history parameters synthesized from the literature to parameterize a numerical population model and generate stock sustainability metrics such as spawning potential ratios (SPR). We found good agreement between predicted average lengths in an unfished population (from our population model) and those observed from diver surveys in the largely unexploited Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. Of 19 exploited reef fish species assessed in the main Hawaiian Islands, 9 had SPRs close to or below the 30{\%} overfishing threshold. In general, longer-lived species such as surgeonfishes, the redlip parrotfish (Scarus rubroviolaceus), and the gray snapper (Aprion virescens) had the lowest SPRs, while short-lived species such as goatfishes and jacks, as well as two invasive species (Lutjanus kasmira and Cephalopholis argus), had SPRs above the 30{\%} threshold.

abstract = {Management of marine resources depends on the assessment of stock status in relation to established reference points. However, many factors contribute to uncertainty in stock assessment outcomes, including data type and availability, life history, and exploitation history. A simulation-estimation framework was used to examine the level of bias and accuracy in assessment model estimates related to the quality and quantity of length and age composition data across three life-history types (cod-, flatfish-, and sardine-like species) and three fishing scenarios. All models were implemented in Stock Synthesis, a statistical age-structured stock assessment framework. In general, the value of age composition data in informing estimates of virgin recruitment (R0), relative spawning-stock biomass (SSB100/SSB0), and terminal year fishing mortality rate (F100), decreased as the coefficient of variation of the relationship between length and age became greater. For this reason, length data were more informative than age data for the cod and sardine life histories in this study, whereas both sources of information were important for the flatfish life history. Historical composition data were more important for short-lived, fast-growing species such as sardine. Infrequent survey sampling covering a longer period was more informative than frequent surveys covering a shorter period.},

abstract = {Catch curve analysis is often used in data-limited fisheries stock assessments to estimate total instantaneous mortality (Z). There are now six catch-curve methods available in the literature: the Chapman-Robson, linear regression, weighted linear regression, Heincke, generalized Poisson linear, and random-intercept Poisson linear mixed model. An assumption shared among the underyling probability models of these estimators is that fish collected for ageing are sampled from the population by simple random sampling. This type of sampling is nearly impossible in fisheries research because populations are sampled in surveys that use gears that capture individuals in clusters and often fish for ageing are selected from multi-stage sampling. In this study, I explored the effects of multi-stage cluster sampling on the bias of the estimates of Z and their associated standard errors. I found that the generalized Poisson linear model and the Chapman-Robson estimators were the least biased, whereas the random-intercept Poisson linear mixed model was the most biased under a wide range of simulation scenarios that included different levels of recruitment variation, intra-cluster correlation, sample sizes, and methods used to generate age frequencies. Standard errors of all estimators were under-estimated in almost all cases and should not be used in statistical comparisons.},

abstract = {State-space stock assessment models have become increasingly common in recent years due to their ability to estimate unobserved variables and explicitly model multiple sources of random error. Therefore, they may be able to better estimate unobserved processes such as misreported fishery catch. We examined whether a state-space assessment model was able to estimate misreported catch in a simulated fishery. We tested three formulations of the estimation model, which exhibit increasing complexity: (i) assuming no misreporting, (ii) assuming misreporting is constant over time, and (iii) assuming misreporting follows a random walk. We tested these three estimation models against simulations using each of the three assumptions and an additional fourth assumption of uniform random misreporting over time. Overall, the worst estimation errors occurred when misreporting was ignored while it was in fact occurring, while there was a relatively small cost for estimating misreporting when it was not occurring. Estimates of population scale and fishing mortality rate were particularly sensitive to misreporting assumptions. Furthermore, in the uniform random scenario, the relatively simple model that assumed misreporting was fixed across ages and time was more accurate than the more complicated random walk model, despite the increased flexibility of the latter.},

abstract = {Many artisanal fisheries lack of conventional scientific data for stock assessment and decision making, which might explain the overexploitation and collapse of many small-scale fish stocks. Fishers' perception has a great potential to be an alternative source of information as it is present in every fishery, is inexpensive and allows analysis at large spatial scales. However, fishers' perception is influenced by psychological factors that can generate bias. This study compares fishers' perception and direct assessment of current and historical abundances of two benthic species that are targeted in the artisanal fishery of Central Chile (the loco and the keyhole limpet), in order to assess the value of the method for artisanal fisheries. The analysis also considered different management regimes (open access areas and areas with territorial rights) and two periods of time (approximately 15 years apart) to determine the (a) the consistency of fishers' perception for assessment of current abundance and (b) the potential use for retrospective assessment. We also compared official landing reports with direct assessments in order to assess the reliability of fisheries data. Fishers' perception of loco abundance generally agreed with direct assessment in fishing villages, management regimes and periods of time. In the case of the keyhole limpet, fishers perceived abundances higher than those registered in direct assessments. The different patterns observed between resources can be related to the relative importance of each fishery. Fishers were not accurate in recalling past abundances retrospectively and official reports showed dramatic mismatches with direct assessment in catch abundance and composition. Fishers' perception is a potential source of information to assess the current abundance of targeted species. However, it requires case by case investigation and evaluation before it can be applied and the information properly integrated in fisheries management practices.},

abstract = {Index-based stock assessments often use time series smoothing to reduce estimation error in their output. However, this may increase error if actual changes in the population are masked by the smoothing. Therefore, it is important to understand how smoothing assessment output will affect estimation accuracy under conditions commonly observed in fish survey time series. Here, we simulated the Georges Bank yellowtail flounder survey time series and assessment in which three bottom trawl surveys are used to estimate the state of the population. We compared the accuracy of the assessment output when it is unsmoothed versus when is smoothed by applying a three-year moving average to the output index. We did so for two estimation models: the currently used empirical assessment model, and a multivariate state-space random walk model. We simulated five biomass trends under two drivers, and examined model performance when one, two, or three surveys were used to fit the model. Overall, the unsmoothed state-space model consistently outperformed the other methods, particularly when there was a rapid change in biomass in the final years, and all three surveys were used to fit the model. The benefit of using the unsmoothed estimate also increased with the underlying rate of change in the population. The advantage gained by using the unsmoothed estimate also increased as additional surveys were used to fit the model. The benefit of using the state-space model versus the empirical model was similar to the benefit of using the unsmoothed versus smoothed estimate. Our results suggest that an unsmoothed state-space model should be used when multiple survey time series are available and population biomass appears to be rapidly changing in recent years.},

Conventional stock assessment tools that rely on length measurements without total catch do not directly account for variable fishing mortality and recruitment over time. However, this equilibrium assumption is likely violated in almost every fishery, degrading estimation performance. We developed an extension of length-only approaches to account for time-varying recruitment and fishing mortality. This Length-based Integrated Mixed Effects (LIME) method at a minimum requires a single year of length data and basic biological information but can fit to multiple years of length data, catch, and an abundance index if available. We use simulation testing to demonstrate that LIME can estimate how much fishing has reduced spawning output in the most recent year across a variety of scenarios for recruitment and fishing mortality. LIME improves data-limited fisheries stock assessments by its flexibility to incorporate additional years or types of data if available and obviates the need for equilibrium assumptions.},

Several potential sources of bias were explored through simulation. The bias was removed by applying an alternative assessment method which used a finer approximation of the integral representing the probability of a crab molting from one size bin. Trade-offs exist at both sides of the bin width spectrum. Precision and model stability may suffer when bin width is too large; slowed parameter estimation and problems fitting multinomial likelihoods to length frequency data may appear when bin widths are too small. Simulation studies (like the one presented here) are useful for identifying optimal bin width for management related tasks.},

abstract = {Estimating fish stock status is very challenging given the many sources and high levels of uncertainty surrounding the biological processes (e.g. natural variability in the demographic rates), model selection (e.g. choosing growth or stock assessment models) and parameter estimation. Incorporating multiple sources of uncertainty in a stock assessment allows advice to better account for the risks associated with proposed management options, promoting decisions that are more robust to such uncertainty. However, a typical assessment only reports the model fit and variance of estimated parameters, thereby underreporting the overall uncertainty. Additionally, although multiple candidate models may be considered, only one is selected as the 'best' result, effectively rejecting the plausible assumptions behind the other models. We present an applied framework to integrate multiple sources of uncertainty in the stock assessment process. The first step is the generation and conditioning of a suite of stock assessment models that contain different assumptions about the stock and the fishery. The second step is the estimation of parameters, including fitting of the stock assessment models. The final step integrates across all of the results to reconcile the multi-model outcome. The framework is flexible enough to be tailored to particular stocks and fisheries and can draw on information from multiple sources to implement a broad variety of assumptions, making it applicable to stocks with varying levels of data availability The Iberian hake stock in International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) Divisions VIIIc and IXa is used to demonstrate the framework, starting from length-based stock and indices data. Process and model uncertainty are considered through the growth, natural mortality, fishing mortality, survey catchability and stock-recruitment relationship. Estimation uncertainty is included as part of the fitting process. Simple model averaging is used to integrate across the results and produce a single assessment that considers the multiple sources of uncertainty.},

abstract = {Fisheries biology encompasses a tremendous diversity of research questions, methods, and models. Many sub-fields use observational or experimental data to make inference about biological characteristics that are not directly observed (called "latent states"), such as heritability of phenotypic traits, habitat suitability, and population densities to name a few. Latent states will generally cause model residuals to be correlated, violating the assumption of statistical independence made in many statistical modelling approaches. In this exposition, we argue that mixed-effect modelling (i) is an important and generic solution to non-independence caused by latent states; (ii) provides a unifying framework for disparate statistical methods such as time-series, spatial, and individual-based models; and (iii) is increasingly practical to implement and customize for problem-specific models. We proceed by summarizing the distinctions between fixed and random effects, reviewing a generic approach for parameter estimation, and distinguishing general categories of non-linear mixed-effect models. We then provide four worked examples, including state-space, spatial, individual-level variability, and quantitative genetics applications (with working code for each), while providing comparison with conventional fixed-effect implementations. We conclude by summarizing directions for future research in this important framework for modelling and statistical analysis in fisheries biology.},

abstract = {Electronic LEngth Frequency ANalysis (ELEFAN) is a widely used method to fit von-Bertalanffy Growth Function (VBGF) using length frequency data for data-poor fisheries. However accuracy of this method depends on diverse assumptions, among which the variability of individual growth may be particularly influential. In addition, the selection of class interval of length frequency data, defined as bin size, is also considerable source of uncertainty. However, rare guidance exists on how to account for the growth variability and to select bin size. In this study, we considered the effects of growth variability and bin size together by testing whether appropriate bin size can reduce estimating bias due to growth variability. We used a Monte Carlo simulation framework to evaluate the performances of ELEFAN under scenarios of different bin size and levels of individual growth variability for 10 fish species. The results indicated that growth variability might result in large variations and biased estimation of growth parameters if the bin size was chosen arbitrarily. On the contrary, there was an optimal bin size for each species, which led to unbiased estimates even in a substantially high level of growth variability. Summarizing the optimal bin sizes of the 10 species, we proposed a rule of thumb to select optimal bin size (OBS) for the future applications of ELEFAN according to the maximum body length (OBS=0.23×Lmax0.6) and age (OBS=1.86×(Lmax/A)0.45) of fish species. The improvement of accuracy of VBGF parameter estimation will help to understand the growth characteristics and reduce the uncertainty for data-limited stock assessment methods.},

@article{Ticheler1998,
abstract = {The feasibility of participation by local fishermen in scientific fisheries data collection for stock assessment is described. Artisanal fishermen from the Bangweulu Swamps, Zambia, collected length-frequency data for 1 year from their catch using the main fishing methods employed in the swamps as well as experimental gears. It is shown that with this method, it is possible to obtain large quantities of reliable and relatively cheap length-frequency data that allow for a full length-based stock assessment, including cohort analysis. There are also indications that with a proper feedback of the findings by the research institutions to the fishing communities, this sampling method might enhance the awareness of exploitation patterns and the management consequences. This may be seen as a first step in preparing the communities to take up their role in a community-based approach in the management of the fish resources.},

@article{DeValpine2005,
abstract = {State-space models are commonly used to incorporate process and observation errors in analysis of fisheries time series. A gap in analysis methods has been the lack of classical likelihood methods for nonlinear state-space models. We evaluate a method that uses weighted kernel density estimates of Bayesian posterior samples to estimate likelihoods (Monte Carlo Kernel Likelihoods, MCKL). Classical likelihoods require integration over the state-space, and we compare MCKL to the widely used errors-in-variables (EV) method, which estimates states jointly with parameters by maximizing a nonintegrated likelihood. For a simulated, linear, autoregressive model and a Schaefer model fit to cape hake (Merluccius capensis x M. paradoxus) data, classical likelihoods outperform EV likelihoods, which give asymptotically biased parameter estimates and inaccurate confidence regions. Our results on the importance of integrated state-space likelihoods also support the value of Bayesian analysis with Monte Carlo posterior integration. Both approaches provide valuable insights and can be used complementarily. Previously, Bayesian analysis was the only option for incorporating process and observation errors with complex nonlinear models. The MCKL method provides a classical approach for such models, so that choice of analysis approach need not depend on model complexity. {\textcopyright} 2005 NRC.},

@article{Thorson2012a,
abstract = {Surplus production represents the processes that affect sustainable fishery harvest and is central to the ecology and management of marine fishes. Taxonomy and life history influence the ratio of spawning biomass at maximum sustainable yield to average unfished spawning biomass (SBMSY/SB0), and estimating this ratio for individual stocks is notoriously difficult. We use a database of published landings data and stock assessment biomass estimates and determine that process errors predominate in this data set by fitting a state-space model to data from each stock individually. We then fit multispecies process-error models while treating SBMSY/SB0 as a random effect that varies by taxonomic order and maximum length. The estimated SBMSY/SB0 = 0.40 for all 147 stocks is intermediate between the values assumed by the Fox and the Schaefer models, although Clupeiformes and Perciformes have lower and Gadiformes and Scorpaeniformes have higher SBMSY/SB0 values. Model selection supports the hypothesis that large-bodied fishes for a given taxonomic order have relatively higher SBMSY/SB0. Results can be used to define reference points for data-poor fisheries or as input in emerging assessment methods.},

@article{Zhang2010,
abstract = {A biomass-based length-cohort analysis (LCA) was examined for its performance in estimating total stock biomass and fishing mortality (F) for a population in equilibrium. We compared two LCA methods—(1) a numbers-based LCA that relies on catch numbers at length as input data and (2) a new biomass-based LCA that relies on catch biomass at length—by applying both to simulated data that generally followed characteristics of Pacific chub mackerel Scomber japonicus in Korean waters. We investigated the effects of using two length aggregation methods, two data simulation methods, and three expressions of weight growth (i.e., exponential growth over the length increment of the analysis, arithmetic mean growth, and geometric mean growth). Biomass and F were estimated from the new model and compared with those estimated from the numbers-based LCA model. A sensitivity analysis was performed to understand which aspect of the model parameters controlled the results. Sensitivity to estimates of terminal F was also examined. Results of the analysis showed that the allometric power coefficient $\beta$ was the most important model parameter and that sensitivity of biomass-based LCA to terminal F was similar to that of numbers-based LCA. Monte Carlo simulation was used to evaluate the equilibrium assumption and to calculate confidence intervals for biomass estimates. We applied the biomass-based LCA model to data for northern rock sole Lepidopsetta polyxystra in the eastern Bering Sea. A comparison of biomass-based LCA population biomass estimates with northern rock sole research survey biomass estimates showed good agreement between the two types of estimates. The biomass-based LCA described in this study is unique in that it incorporates growth explicitly into the estimation procedure, which can be useful under data-deficient situations when simple length composition data and estimates of total catch biomass from just one sampling year are the only available data. {\textcopyright} 2010 Taylor  {\&}  Francis Group, LLC.},

@article{Zhou2012a,
abstract = {The rule of thumb that fishing mortality to achieve maximum sustainable yield (FMSY) equals natural mortality (M) has been both criticised and supported by theoretical arguments. However, the relationship has been rarely investigated using empirical data. We carried out a meta-analysis on 245 fish species worldwide and linked three types of reference points (FBRP: FMSY, Fproxy, and F0.5r) to M and other life history parameters (LHP). We used Bayesian hierarchical errors-invariables models to investigate the relationships and included the effect of taxonomic class and order. We compared various models and found that natural mortality is the most important LHP affecting FBRP. Other covariates, such as von Bertalanffy growth coefficient, asymptotic length, maximum age, and habitat types, add little to the relationship, partially because of correlation and large measurement and process errors. The best model results in FMSY = 0.87M (standard deviation (SD) = 0.05) for teleosts and FMSY = 0.41M (SD = 0.09) for chondrichthyans. Fproxy based on per-recruit analysis is about 15{\%} smaller than FMSY. Results could be used to estimate FBRP from LHP in data-poor situations.},

@article{Yin2004,
abstract = {Assessments for many U.S. Pacific coast groundfish stocks have been developed using the statistical catch-at-age method known as Stock Synthesis. This study used Monte Carlo sim- ulation and a fractional factorial experiment to evaluate the effects of input data errors and stock characteristics on bias and precision in estimates of ending exploitable biomass, rate of fishing mortality, depletion, and other output variables. Nine factors were examined: length of the data series, rate of natural mortality, shape of the fishery selectivity curve, trend in fishing mortality, recruitment pattern, and level of sampling error in the data for catch, fishing effort, a survey biomass index, and sample size for fishery and survey age compositions. Length of the data series, age composition sample size, survey biomass variability, and fishing effort variability were the most influential factors for most of the output variables. The estimates of depletion had the least bias and the estimates of starting biomass the smallest variability; the estimates of ending re- cruitment had the greatest bias and largest variability. For all the output variables examined the estimates appeared to be median-unbiased. For the conditions considered in the experiment, it appears that the accuracy of assessment estimates for ending exploitable biomass and projected catch would be more readily improved by increased age composition sampling than by comparable (but much more expensive) improvements in survey estimates of stock biomass.},
